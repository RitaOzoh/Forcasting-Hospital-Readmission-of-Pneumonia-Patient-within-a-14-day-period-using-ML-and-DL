# Forcasting-Hospital-Readmission-of-Pneumonia-Patient-within-a-14-day-period-using-ML-and-DL
This research project aims to investigate the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning techniques in predicting unplanned hospital readmissions of pneumonia patients within a 14-day timeframe. 

Leveraging advanced data analysis and predictive modelling, the study will analyze historical patient data to develop accurate and efficient forecasting models. The findings will shed light on the potential of these techniques to improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resources. This project contributes to the growing field of AI-driven healthcare decision-making and may have significant implications for reducing readmission rates and enhancing patient care strategies. Contributions and collaborations are welcome to enhance the study's accuracy and impact.
